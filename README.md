<h1>Building an Active Directory Environment with Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Teamn</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Are you starting your journey in cybersecurity or IT and want to see how all the pieces fit together?
This hands-on home lab project will walk you through building a simulated corporate network environment to learn how attacks are detected and defended against in the real world.
<br />


<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<b>In this lab, you will set up:</b> 
- <b>Active Directory – to simulate a real-world domain environment</b> 
- <b>Splunk – as your SIEM for log collection and analysis</b>
- <b>Kali Linux – to simulate attacker activity</b>
- <b>Atomic Red Team – to safely generate real-world attack techniques and telemetry</b>


<h2>What You Will Learn </h2>

<b>By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:</b>
- <b>Understanding how a domain environment operates</b>
- <b>Ingesting and analyzing security events with Splunk</b>
- <b>Simulating attacks and generating detection telemetry</b>
- <b>Mapping telemetry to detection rules to identify malicious activity</b>
- <b>Connecting the dots between attacks, logs, and detections</b>


<h2>Why This Project Matters:</h2>
<b>This isn’t just theory—this lab gives you the skills to detect, analyze, and respond to real-world threats.
Whether you’re a beginner or looking to sharpen your detection engineering skills, you’ll leave with:</b>

- <b>Practical knowledge of how security tools work together</b>
- <b>Confidence in working with SIEMs and Active Directory </b>
- <b>A portfolio-ready project to showcase your skills to employers</b>
